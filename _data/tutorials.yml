  intro: >
    <p>Every year, as part of the F8 conference, Facebook builds iOS and Android apps that give attendees a schedule for the conference, and let them learn more about the talks and speakers. The apps have also provided reminders for upcoming talks and ad-hoc announcements to attendees.</p>

    <p>This year, we wanted to not only release the <a href="https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app/" target="_blank">source code on GitHub</a>, but also to produce a series of tutorials. These were designed to introduce React Native and its Open Source ecosystem in plain English.</p>

    <p>This tutorial series has been written during the app's development. Elements, such as code samples, will continue to evolve and improve over time after the app has been released - <a href="/feed">subscribe to keep up to date</a>.</p>

    <p>Comments and feedback are welcome via <a href="https://github.com/facebook/makeitopen/issues">GitHub issues</a>. The tutorials are designed to be readable individually, but we recommend reading through in sequence.</p>
